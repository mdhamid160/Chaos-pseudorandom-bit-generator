# Cryptographic Pseudo-Random Bit Generator Based on New Combination Discrete Chaotic Systems
Traditional 1-D discrete chaotic systems are not suitable to use directly in PRBG design for their cryptographic usage as their structures are simple and have predictability. Pseudo-random sequences have wide applications in image and video encryption, hash functions, spread spectrum communications, etc. In chaos-based cryptography, chaotic systems have been regarded as an important pseudorandom source in the design of pseudo-random bit generators due to its inherent properties of sensitive dependence on initial conditions and parameters. In order to improve the dynamism and features of standard logistic map, a 1-D discrete combination chaos model is proposed in this paper. The chaos model enables to construct new chaotic systems with combination of logistic map and Trigonometric functions. The performance analysis shows that the new systems are more complex and better than the original Logistic map. Further, we also propose to present a new pseudo-random bit generator based on new log-tan chaotic system and log-cot chaotic system. The randomness and other statistic analysis show that our pseudo-random bit generator has good randomness features, satisfy the linear complexity and balancedness requirements well
